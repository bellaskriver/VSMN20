Documentation for worksheet 3

Breif explanation of geometric model:
The groundwaterflow problem was chosen and the geometry is created accordingly. There are 8 nodes, well named in flowmodel_3.py,
which mark the edges of the mesh as well as the placemnet of the barrier. Between these splines are placed to create edges.
The width of the entire geometry is w=100m, the height is h=10m, the depth of the barrier id d=5m, and the thisckness of the barrier is t=0.5m.

Analysis of parameter study results:
The parameter study is done for the flow in relation to the depth of the barrier. The depth varied between 1 and 9 meters, 
were the results showed a minimal flow for a barrier with a depth of 7m. This information could be advantageus
to minimize the flow, due to this often times being the aim of adding a barrier.

Challenges:
A big challange was the code not running. This was due to the version of Python and numpy being too "up to date" and not 
cooperating with CALFEM and mac OS. This was solved by reinstalling the older versions of python and numpy. Another problem 
occured due to an error with "Qt", which required installing PyQt5, even though it isn't used for anything.
